# Convex Hull Algorithms 

## Overview

This repository provides a simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing and running various convex hull algorithms. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Getting Started

1. **Run GUI**: Execute the program and open the GUI interface.
2. **Generate Points**: Click the "Generate Points" button to populate the canvas with random points.

## Convex Hull Algorithms

Choose from the following convex hull algorithms to visualize and run:

1. **Brute Force**
2. **Jarvis' March**
3. **Graham Scan**
4. **Divide & Conquer**

Select the algorithm you want to run, and observe how each algorithm computes the convex hull of the given set of points.

## LeftHull Algorithm (Simple Polygon Convex Hull)

For the special case of a simple polygon convex hull, follow these steps:

1. **Clear Lines**: Remove existing lines from the canvas.
2. **Clear Points**: Clear any existing points on the canvas.
3. **Chart Vertices**: Click on the canvas to chart the vertices of a simple polygon in a clockwise manner.
4. **Run Polygon**: Execute the algorithm to compute the convex hull of the simple polygon.
