# Convex Hull Algorithms

Steps
1. Run GUI
2. Click generate points button
  
### Now you can run the following convex hull algorithms
1. Brute Force 
2. Jarvis' March 
3. Graham Scan 
4. Divide & Conquer

### To run LeftHull algorithm (Simple Polygon convex hull)
1. Clear Lines
2. Clear Points
3. Chart vertices of simple polygon in clockwise manner by using mouse click
4. Run polygon

# GUI looks like this and is made using tkinter
